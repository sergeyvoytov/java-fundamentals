#Lab 6: Composition and Inheritance, Part 1
In today’s lab, I created classes and interfaces to represent reviews of restaurants.

##Tasks implemented:
###Restaurant class
- Created a class to represent a Restaurant. 
- Implemented a Restaurant constructor.
- Tested that the Restaurant constructor is behaving reasonably.
- Implemented toString method for Restaurants.
- Wrote  a test to create an instance of Restaurant and ensure that its toString is working properly.
### Review class

- Created a class to represent a Review. Each Review should have a body, an author, and a number of stars.
- Wrote a Review constructor.
- Tested that your constructor is working reasonably.
- Implemented a reasonable toString method for Reviews.
- wrote a test to create an instance of Review and ensure that its toString is working properly.
### The method I chose was that a Restaurant knows which Reviews are about it
- Created the method should take in a Review instance, and associate that review with this Restaurant. 
- Added tests to ensure that when you call addReview, the association is created between the Restaurant and the Review.
- When I associate a review with a restaurant, that restaurant’s star rating  changes.

##Wendsday Lab:

Created 2 new classes with the constructors and reviews and testing cases
